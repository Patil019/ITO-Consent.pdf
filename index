I have availed loan facility through Rupeek with Federal Bank with Gold Loan Account No ${customerData.secGlId} and Unsecured loan from RCPL with Loan Account No ${customerData.unsecGlId}. The Loan facilities availed by me are due for renewal. Hence, I have approached Rupeek Capital Pvt Ltd for closure of loan facilities on my behalf. I consent and acknowledge that Rupeek Capital Private Limited will be making loan closure payments for the above mentioned loans on my behalf.

I confirm that the outstanding towards the loan amount as on date ${todayDate} for loan closure stands at ${todayClosureOs || customerData.closureOs}.

Further, I also agree, consent and undertake to release the collateral (gold) and book a loan facility with 
Rupeek Capital Private Limited against the same collateral. I further confirm that I am the absolute owner 
of the collateral under pledge and there are no disputes pending and the collateral is unencumbered. I 
acknowledge that assessment of purity and weight of the Collateral by the Company at the time of pledging 
the Collateral is only based on a preliminary verification carried out at the time of granting the Loan 
and is not final and binding on the Company. I acknowledge, undertake and confirm that if the collateral 
(gold) pledged is found to be of not of the represented purity and weight or if found to be spurious in 
nature, I explicitly undertake to make good of the shortfall by pledging additional gold jewellery or 
make the repayment immediately.

I also acknowledge and undertake that in the event of any difference amount arising out of appraisal, 
recovery dues, charges, penalties pending against the loan facilities will be added against the new loan 
facility or I also undertake to repay the pending due amounts prior to booking of new loan as applicable.

I undertake and authorise Rupeek Capital Pvt Ltd to transfer the bona fide loan amount for closure of loans 
against the above mentioned loan accounts.

I explicitly state that above consent and declaration are given by me voluntarily and from my free will, 
without any coercion or undue influence.
